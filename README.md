# CTRP (Connected Textures Resourse Pack)

[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/ctrp)

### Let's take a look how it works

This is the default texture of glass block in minecraft:

![glass](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be53c6c0-02c9-4a46-a4c8-06dbbe70e088)

This texture is applied on all sides of glass

But with CTRP texture of glass change into:

![glass](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9333d9b9-34bb-4fb9-862a-5a0f909bc836)

With library and function [Fusion (Connected textures)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fusion-connected-textures) mod, glass can connect to same blocks

Here is example of glass block:
